# SheShield – Community-Driven Safety & Assistance Platform (Concept Project)

SheShield is an early-stage concept application designed to support women’s safety and provide community-powered assistance in urban environments, starting with Jamshedpur, India.
This project explores low-cost, scalable ways to tackle real safety and mobility challenges without depending on standard SOS/location-sharing systems built into smartphones.

📌 Project Status

🚧 Concept Stage
This repository contains experiments, planning documents, UI ideas, and prototype logic.
Full application development has not yet started and is dependent on future funding, collaboration, and community input.

🎯 Vision

Create a simple, reliable, low-investment safety tool that:

Supports women in vulnerable or uncomfortable situations

Does not rely on SOS, GPS tracking, or sensitive data

Encourages community participation

Operates locally in Jamshedpur

Remains transparent, privacy-respecting, and user-friendly

SheShield is built around solving real societal problems such as:

Women feeling unsafe walking alone, especially at night

Lack of reliable support when stuck in unfamiliar or stressful situations

Inconsistent or overpriced roadside help for drivers

No unified system connecting verified local helpers, mechanics, volunteers, and citizens

💡 Core Ideas (Concept Features)
1. Women’s Safety

Community-rated safe/unsafe routes

Local shop/area “safe spots” verified by citizens

Scheduled Check-Ins (non-SOS, non-tracking)

Quick-access directory for trusted local help

Offline-friendly safety utilities

2. Volunteer-Driven Roadside Support

Tie-ups with local mechanics in Jamshedpur

Users can browse spare parts + mechanic service availability

Volunteers can transport parts to stranded users

Transparent, fixed-rate price listings to prevent overcharging

Subscription model for requesters and helpers

🚀 Goals

Build a practical, community-supported platform

Keep development affordable (small-scale, low server cost)

Avoid complex AI/ML or heavy infrastructure

Maintain user privacy at every step

Grow through local awareness, trust, and transparency
